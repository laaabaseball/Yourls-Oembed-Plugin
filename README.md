# Yourls Oembed Plugin.

Requires https://github.com/laaabaseball/jquery-oembed-all to be put in a folder called oembed in the plugin folder.

This plugin takes all URLS with some exceptions and pulls them into an embed into the site. Many sites listed here https://github.com/starfishmod/jquery-oembed-all as well as a few adult sites, vine, and wikipedia have been added with my code.
